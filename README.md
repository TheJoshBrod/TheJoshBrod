# About me! 

Hi, I'm Josh! I’m currently a fourth-year student studying CS at the University of Michigan. 

Whether making a Data Visualization tool for an Electric Motorcycle, a Website to have a [Shared Spotify Queue](https://github.com/michiganhackers/spotify-open-source-proj), or a [Mini-Game Discord Bot](https://github.com/TheJoshBrod/TheGameBot) to play with your friends, I am passionate about creating cool projects that have an impact.
I have a strong background in full-stack web development and data manipulation. 
Despite my background, I don't shy away from a challenge; if I have an idea, I strive to make it a reality.

Fun Fact, I also love being outdoors and have been to 20+ national parks 🌳
