# About me! 

Hi, I'm Josh! I’m currently a fourth-year student studying CS at the University of Michigan. 

Whether making an Electric Motorcycle Data Visualization tool for Live Telemetry, a Website to have a [Shared Spotify Queue](https://github.com/michiganhackers/spotify-open-source-proj), or a [AI Powered Fitness App](https://github.com/jayphil123/trAIn) to play with your friends, I am passionate about creating cool projects that have an impact.

I have a strong background in full-stack web development, data manipulation.
My current focus is learning more about AI and its applications.

No matter the challenge, when I have an idea, I am determined to turn it into reality.

Fun Fact, I also love being outdoors and have been to 20+ national parks 🌳
